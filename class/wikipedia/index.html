        <section>
            <p>The Diamondback is an independent student newspaper associated with the University of Maryland, College
                Park. It began in 1910 as The Triangle and became known as The Diamondback in 1921. Now a weekly online
                journal, The Diamondback was published as a daily print newspaper on weekdays until 2013. It is
                published by Maryland Media, Inc., a non-profit organization. The newspaper receives no university
                funding and derives its revenue from advertising.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Diamondback was founded in 1910 as The Triangle. The name was then changed a few times to The M.A.C.
                Weekly, Maryland State Review, and University Review. The newspaper was renamed again in 1921 to The
                Diamondback, in honor of a local reptile, the Diamondback terrapin (the terrapin became the official
                school mascot in 1933). In the 1930s, the newspaper was printed weekly, increasing to five times per
                week by the 1950s and distributed for free at various campus locations, until the Friday edition was
                eliminated in 2013. In 2015, the four days per week publication was reduced to a weekly print edition.
                The change mirrored a nationwide trend in student newspapers at U.S. universities in the 2010s, such as
                at the University of Wisconsin, University of Nebraska, and Arizona State, where daily print editions
                were dropped as readers increasingly gravitated towards social media and online news sources. In March,
                2020, the print edition of the newspaper was discontinued altogether. By then, it was published once a
                week on Monday, with a print circulation of 8,000, down from a high of more than 21,000, and what used
                to be annual advertising revenues of more than $1 million. It was usually twelve to sixteen pages.</p>
            <p>Over the years, the newspaper has been noted for its willingness to challenge authority. In 1935, The
                Diamondback sharply criticized then-University President Raymond A. Pearson, saying in an editorial that
                faculty morale was deteriorating following salary cuts and the departure of highly regarded professors
                had resulted in lowered academic standing. In response, the Board of Regents formed a special committee
                for a "full investigation". Pearson defended the salary cuts as due to reduced state funding
                attributable to the Depression and denied that scholastic excellence had been impaired. Pearson
                subsequently resigned.</p>
            <p>In a November, 1940, editorial written in the wake of a disappointing football season, the Diamondback
                called for the university to provide football scholarships. Saying that state universities "cannot
                afford not to have a good football team", the editorial added, "the boys who play college football
                deserve financial aid where they need it. They work hard enough in the course of a season to qualify for
                pay on a full time job".</p>
            <p>In 1972, the Board of Regents granted Maryland Media Inc. a non-profit charter and free office space on
                campus, under which the Diamondback operates independently. The newspaper receives no university funding
                and derives its revenue from advertising.</p>
            <p>In 1996, the Diamondback was described by Maryland's largest newspaper, The Baltimore Sun, as having a
                "hard-edged reputation", especially when compared to student newspapers at other colleges in the state.
                In 2001, a controversy erupted between The Diamondback and the university's journalism school when the
                Diamondback's student staff objected to the Dean of Journalism's proposal that publisher Maryland Media
                hire a paid editorial advisor for the newsroom, accusing the Dean of a "takeover" that would jeopardize
                the newspaper's independence. The month before, the Baltimore Sun reported that Maryland Media had a $4
                million surplus, with the Diamondback's non-student manager paid $179,123 and potentially earning as
                much as $300,000 per year, further exacerbating relations.</p>
            <p>As of 2022, The Diamondback publishes a daily digital-only edition during the school year at dbknews.com.
                It has been independently published since 1972 by Maryland Media, a non-profit corporation. The paper's
                offices are located on the third floor of the South Campus Dining Hall, across from the WMUC-FM radio
                station and the University of Maryland's Residence Hall Association office. As of September 2019, the
                newspaper's editor said that The Diamondback's website had 160,000 visitors for the month.</p>
