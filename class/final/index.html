        <p>If you asked a kid off the street today what their current favorite movie was, chances are they’d tell you
            it’s Sonic. It may not be the most popular answer, but kids across the country share a love for the movie
            based on a 30-year-old game.</p>
        <p>If you walk into a room of young adults and ask what their favorite current TV show was, you would likely not
            be shocked to hear someone reply The Last of Us.
        </p>
        <p>The one thing both of these incredibly popular fictional powerhouses have in common is they both came,
            initially, from a video game. The first Sonic game, Sonic the Hedgehog, was released in 1991 for the Sega
            Genesis while the original game for The Last of Us game out on the PlayStation 3 in 2013.</p>
        <p>They are so widespread that you could be a fan of either of them and still have no idea what the source
            material was. But 20 years ago, this was unfathomable.
        </p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Video games have existed for as long as most of us have been alive. If you reach back
            far enough, you’ll find
            they technically originated in the 1950s in a format we’d hesitate to call a video game today.</p>
        <p>For our purposes, we will start in the 1980s, the birthplace of the NES, also known as the Nintendo
            Entertainment System. The NES was many things, and in a time of growth for technology, it allowed new
            things
            to be explored and exposed to the general public. But perhaps the most influential thing the NES did was
            facilitate the birth and development of a very special game, Super Mario Bros.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Mario games transcend generations in a special way many other bits of media could only hope to do. And for
            all its popularity, it was gifted something no other video game had been before - a movie.
        </p>
        <p>The Super Mario Bros movie, which came out in 1993, is widely regarded as a terrible movie, having received a
            Rotten Tomatoes Score of only 29%, but this set up a trend for the next 25 years.

        <p>From 1993 to 2015, the trend of video-game-adapted movies continued, with each of the highest-grossing movies
            for the year failing time and time again. Until something incredible happened. Somewhere between the failure
            of Hitman Agent 47 in 2015 and the incredible success of Sonic the Hedgehog in 2020, a shift occurred.</p>

        <p>Now, the highest-grossing movies from the last five years have all received over 50% scores on Rotten
            Tomatoes.

        <p>But these movies are, primarily, children’s movies. Although 2018’s Rampage received a rating of PG-13 and
            2021’s Mortal Kombat was rated R, the movies that really did well were the ones marketed to and intended for
            children.</p>
        <p>So, have adaptations marketed to adults improved?</p>
